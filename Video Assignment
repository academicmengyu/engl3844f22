What: For this project, you will work collaboratively in a group of three or four and produce five to eight minutes of video illustrating a topic of your choice. Your video must be original—using footage you have collected on your own time—and should explain a subject to a group of general, non-expert audience. This project is an opportunity to showcase your rhetorical skills by consciously employing the strategies and appeals. It also requires you to work collaboratively with your group members and finish a project.
Outcomes:
•	You will demonstrate skills in audio and video recording and editing to create a rhetorically effective text.
•	You will talk in a generally knowledgeable way about video texts, how to compose them, and how they are structured in terms of compositional elements.
•	You will demonstrate a consideration of purpose, information, audience, and other rhetorical considerations, as it they relate to your documentary topic.

How:  
People: Based on your familiar video editing software, you will form a group with three or four students.

Topic: Then discuss with your group members and choose something that you and your group members are passionate about and/or can have fun with. It can be a topic you are personally invested in, or something that we’ve discussed in class. 

Some examples could be bad grammar on Facebook, a historical event, what to do in Blacksburg/surrounding area. You can check this page for more ideas.

Genre:  You will want to consider a video genre appropriate for the topic and your intended audience. In approaching this project, feel free to make up your own word, slogan, product, or persona and use it to teach your audience to feel, understand, learn your topic, or even take actions. The form you choose is up to you; some options you may want to consider (but should not feel limited to choose from) are documentary, narrative short-film, vlog, music video, commercial or infomercial parody, instructional video, cartoon, an idea you come up with.
You may NOT create: A slideshow style –i.e., PowerPoint or Prezi—video; Mukbang, purely video game streaming, or any video with a little message to deliver.

Once you’ve chosen a topic and appropriate video genre, you’ll need to flesh out your stance and approach, as well as what you know about the rhetorical situation. Consider:  
•	Who/what will be your audience(s), context, genre, constraints, stance, design, and purpose?
•	What is the information do you want to deliver to your audience? (You must be very familiar with the topic, which means you need to do some research on the topic.)
•	What is your ultimate goal in creating this piece of rhetoric? 
•	How do you explain a topic clearly to general audience (non-expert audience) in a short video? 
•	What rhetorical devices do you want to employ?

Next, you’ll want to create a detailed script and storyboard for your project. A script will help you develop your message through scenes, narration, actor dialogue, and scene-text. A storyboard will help you map out the visual shots you need in your video, and pair them with corresponding parts of the script, as well as any music or graphics you want to add. Remember to revise and edit both the script and the storyboard; these guides will ensure you’re capturing the footage you need. 

When your script and storyboard are complete, you’re ready to begin filming.  Once you’ve collected footage, you can use some easy video editing software (e.g. iMovie or Movie Maker) to edit the material into a polished product. 
Requirements:
•	A team must submit a self-contained, original video that includes:
o	A catchy headline that engages your audience
o	Clearly explained topic with in-depth and comprehensive research
o	Relevant, specific details that inform your audience about the topic
o	Consciously employed rhetorical devices in order to persuade your audience to do, think, or feel something 
o	A strong sense of audience
o	A coherent organizational structure or design that makes sense for the genre
o	Final credits that cite any sources used
o	5-8 minutes. If you believe the length of your video should be out of the required range, we can discuss about it.
•	Each team member also needs to submit a memo (1-2 pages) includes: 
o	A short paragraph about the audience and the purpose of this video and any contextual information.
o	The role of being a group member: what did you contribute to your team?
o	A reflection on the collaborative drafting and producing this video
•	Bonus credit: you can choose to upload your video to a streaming platform. The groups that have the most views or receive the most likes within the first two weeks of release will receive extra credit.
